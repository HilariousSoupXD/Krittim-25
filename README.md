# Krittim Workshop 2025 â€“ Robotics Projects

Welcome to the repository showcasing the projects I built during **Krittim Workshop 2025**, organized by **N.E.R.D.S., the Robotics Club of NIT Silchar**. I was among the top 50 selected from 250+ students through a rigorous quiz (in which I secured the highest score) and had the opportunity to dive into hands-on robotics across three days.

## ðŸ”§ Projects Included

### 1. ðŸ¦– Chrome Dino Game Simulation (Wokwi)

A simulation of the classic Dino game circuit, built on **Wokwi** using:
- **Arduino UNO**
- **Push Button**
- **LED**
- **Buzzer**

> This task was part of Day 1, focused on microcontroller basics and virtual prototyping.

### 2. ðŸ¤– Hand Gesture-Controlled Robot

A real hardware project using:
- **MPU6050 Accelerometer**
- **NRF24L01 Wireless Module**
- **Arduino Nano/UNO**
- **Motor Driver (L298N)**

> Built in a team of 10 during Day 2. Our team was one of the **only two out of five** to successfully implement and demonstrate the bot within the deadline.

## ðŸš€ Highlights

- Applied fundamentals of embedded systems and robotics
- Built both virtual simulations and real-world hardware projects
- Collaborated under strict deadlines to achieve working prototypes
- Explored drone tech and Mission Planner on Day 3 (not coded but insightful)
